            my_hash: This variable likely starts with an initial value, often 0 or some seed value, which will be updated iteratively for each letter in a given string.
            ord(letter): The ord() function in Python returns the Unicode code point (an integer) for a given character letter. For example, ord('A') returns 65.
            ord(letter) * 23: The Unicode code point of the character letter is multiplied by 23. 
            The number 23 is a constant chosen to help spread out the hash values, reducing collisions in the hash table. Itâ€™s common to use prime numbers or constants in hashing to improve distribution.
            my_hash + ord(letter) * 23: The current value of my_hash is updated by adding the product of the Unicode code point and the constant 23.
            % len(self.data_map): The modulo operation is used to ensure the hash value stays within the bounds of the hash table's array. self.data_map is the array (or list) representing the hash table, and len(self.data_map) gives the size of this array. 
            he modulo operation ensures the hash value wraps around if it exceeds the array length, keeping the index within valid bounds.
